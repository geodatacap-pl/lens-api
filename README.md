## Usage

This server API handles requests related to face and person detection. It includes endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting detection records.

### Example Request

To create a new detection record, send a POST request to the appropriate endpoint with the required data.

## API Endpoints

Here are some of the key endpoints available in this API:

- **GET /detections/**: Retrieve a list of all detections.
- **POST /detections/**: Create a new detection record.
- **GET /detections/{id}/**: Retrieve a specific detection record by ID.
- **PUT /detections/{id}/**: Update a specific detection record by ID.
- **DELETE /detections/{id}/**: Delete a specific detection record by ID.
